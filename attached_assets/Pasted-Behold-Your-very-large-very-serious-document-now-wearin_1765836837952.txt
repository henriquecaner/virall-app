Profile Studio

Functional Requirements: Profile Studio

1. Overview

Create a separate feature called Profile Studio, where users can build and refine their creator personality profile. This feature is NOT part of the mandatory onboarding flow, but is encouraged after onboarding completion via a tooltip or prompt.

Profile Studio allows users to:
	1.	Answer 4 essential personality questions
	2.	Optionally take personality tests (DISC, Big Five, etc.)
	3.	View a visualization of their complete profile
	4.	Edit and refine it at any time

Goal: Create a “personality studio” users visit when they want to fine-tune how their posts sound, not during the initial onboarding flow.

⸻

2. Onboarding Removal

2.1 What Changes in Onboarding

Onboarding steps remain:
	1.	Language
	2.	Industry
	3.	Professional description
	4.	Target audience
	5.	Post topics
	6.	Qualification

Onboarding ends ONLY with a basic profile:
	•	User completes the 6 steps
	•	System saves the basic profile (language, industry, description, audience, topics, qualification)
	•	Personality remains blank / not configured

⸻

3. Post-Onboarding Prompt

3.1 When to Show

Trigger: Immediately after the user completes Step 6 (Qualification) and clicks “Finish Profile.”

Before redirecting to the Dashboard:
	•	Show an incentive tooltip / modal / overlay

3.2 Prompt Content

Visual elements:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✨ Profile Created Successfully!

Want your posts to sound EXACTLY like you?

Complete your profile in Profile Studio:
✓ 4 quick questions about your style
✓ Personality tests (DISC, Big Five)
✓ Fine-tune your tone of voice

the quality of your posts.

[Complete Profile Now] [Do It Later]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Button behavior:
	•	Complete Profile Now → Redirects to /profile-studio → Opens Profile Studio at the first section
	•	Do It Later → Closes tooltip → Redirects to /dashboard → Show menu badge: “Complete your profile” (persists until completion)

3.3 Follow-Up Reminders

If the user chooses “Do It Later”:

Dashboard (first visit):
	•	Subtle top banner: “💡 Complete your profile in Profile Studio for more personalized posts”
	•	Button: “Complete Now”
	•	Can be dismissed (X), but reappears in future sessions

Navigation Menu:
	•	“Profile Studio” item with notification badge (orange/yellow dot)
	•	Badge disappears after profile completion

Email (3 days later if still incomplete):
	•	Subject: “Your posts can sound even more like you”
	•	Content: Profile Studio benefits + CTA
	•	Sent once only (no spam)

⸻
