Build a comprehensive Full-Stack SaaS application for LinkedIn Viral Content Creation and Management. The app should use React (Vite) for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a modern, clean, and "dark mode" aesthetic suitable for professional creators.

Here is the detailed specification and required features:

### 1. CORE LOGIC & KNOWLEDGE BASE
- **Context:** I have uploaded several `.md` files to the root directory. These files contain specific frameworks (AIDA, BAB, FAB), viral hooks, tone of voice guidelines, and content structures.
- **AI Integration:** Integrate with the Anthropic API (Claude). The backend must read the uploaded `.md` files and inject them as "System Prompts" or "Context" when generating content.
- **Logic:** The AI should not just "write a post," but follow a guided structure based on the user's selected framework (e.g., if user selects AIDA, the AI explicitly generates Attention, Interest, Desire, Action sections based on the logic in the markdown files).

### 2. USER JOURNEY & AUTHENTICATION
- **Landing & Auth:** Create a landing page. Implement Authentication (use Passport.js or a simple JWT implementation, or Clerk if available in environment) supporting Email/Password and LinkedIn Social Login (OAuth 2.0 placeholder).
- **Onboarding Flow (Wizard):**
  1. **Persona Discovery:** A multi-step form asking about the user's role, industry, and tone of voice.
  2. **Implication/Goals:** Ask what they want to achieve (Leads, Authority, Networking).
  - *Save these preferences to the user's profile in the database to personalize future generations.*

### 3. MAIN FEATURES
- **Content Studio:**
  - A dashboard where users can create a new post.
  - **Selector:** Dropdowns for Framework (BAB, AIDA, FAB), Objective, and "Vibe" (Controversial, Educational, Storytelling).
  - **Editor:** A rich text editor to view and tweak the AI-generated content.
- **LinkedIn Integration (Mock/Structure):**
  - Create the backend routes to handle LinkedIn API for:
    1. `POST /share`: To publish content.
    2. `GET /analytics`: To retrieve likes, comments, and impressions.
  - *Note: Since actual OAuth requires keys, build the structure and mock the response for now so I can test the UI.*
- **Scheduler & Queue:**
  - A visual calendar view (react-big-calendar or similar) showing scheduled posts.
  - A "Queue" list view for upcoming content.

### 4. ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
- Create a visual dashboard using charting libraries (like Recharts).
- Display metrics: Total Impressions, Engagement Rate, Top Performing Posts.
- **Browser Extension Prep:** Create a dedicated API endpoint (`/api/external/stats`) that a future browser extension could hit to send/receive data.

### 5. UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- **Vibe:** High-end, "pro" tool. Think linear.app or Raycast style.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully mobile-responsive.
- **Feedback Loops:** After a post is generated, allow the user to rate it (Thumbs up/down). Save this feedback to refine future prompts for that specific user.

### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1. Set up the PostgreSQL schema (Users, Posts, Personas, Analytics).
2. Initialize the Express server with Anthropic SDK.
3. specific function to parse the local `.md` files into a string for the LLM context.
4. Build the React frontend with the Onboarding Wizard and Dashboard.
5. Connect the frontend forms to the backend AI generation endpoints.

Start by setting up the database schema and the backend server structure.
