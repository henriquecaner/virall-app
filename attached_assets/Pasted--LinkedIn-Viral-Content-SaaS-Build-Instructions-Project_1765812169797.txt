- CTA: "Começar" → /signup

### 2. Auth Pages
- /signup - Email/password + Google + LinkedIn OAuth
- /login - Same options
- /reset-password - Email-based reset

### 3. Onboarding (/onboarding) - 6 Steps
**REQUIRED before accessing app**

Step 1: Language (dropdown)
Step 2: Industry (text input)
Step 3: Professional Description (textarea, 20-500 chars)
Step 4: Target Audience (multi-tag input, 1-10 tags)

- Delete post (with confirmation)

### 5. Content Studio (/studio)
**Chat-style interface like Claude.ai**

7-Step Workflow:

**STEP 1: Briefing**
- System suggests 3-5 topics based on user profile
- Asks: objective, available data, preferred topic
- Stores context for next steps

**STEP 2: Structure Selection**
- Offers 3 copywriting structures (PAS, AIDA, BAB, FAB, HSO, Storytelling)
- Indicates recommended option
- User selects one

**STEP 3: Content Type**
- Offers 3 content types from 16 available
- Based on structure + objective
- User selects one

**STEP 4: Hook Creation**
- Generates 3 hooks (authority+data, personal narrative, tension/contrast)
- User can regenerate (max 10x per step)
- Regeneration modes: new, variations, specific feedback

**STEP 5: Body Construction**
- Builds complete post using all previous choices
- Follows structure, applies user profile
- Target: 1,250-3,000 chars, 14+ short paragraphs
- User can request adjustments

**STEP 6: CTA Selection**
- Offers 3 CTAs based on objective
- Types: engagement, save, conversion
- User selects one

**STEP 7: Score & Validation**
- Calculates score (0-10) based on:
  - Hook quality (30%)
  - Structure/length (25%)
  - Data usage (15%)
  - CTA clarity (15%)
  - Algorithm alignment (15%)
- Shows predictive analytics (top 1%, top 5% probability)
- Suggests best day/time to post

**CRITICAL RULE:** If score < 9, system auto-generates improved version. User CANNOT save posts with score < 9.

### 6. Settings (/settings)

## 📊 Scoring Algorithm

```javascript
function calculateScore(hook, body, cta) {
  const hookScore = evaluateHook(hook); // 0-10
  const structureScore = evaluateStructure(body); // 0-10
  const dataScore = evaluateData(body); // 0-10
  const ctaScore = evaluateCTA(cta); // 0-10
  const algorithmScore = evaluateAlgorithm(hook + body + cta); // 0-10
  
  return (
    hookScore * 0.30 +
    structureScore * 0.25 +
    dataScore * 0.15 +
    ctaScore * 0.15 +
    algorithmScore * 0.15
  );
}

// Predictive Analytics
function getPredictions(score) {
  if (score >= 10) return { top1: 40, top5: 85 };
  if (score >= 9.5) return { top1: 30, top5: 70 };
  if (score >= 9.0) return { top1: 20, top5: 60 };
  // ...
}

⚠️ Critical Business Rules
Score ≥9 Required: Cannot save posts with score < 9
Profile Always Active: All generated content considers user profile
8 Posts/Month Limit: Hard limit, resets on 1st of month
Onboarding Required: No access to Content Studio without completed profile
Clone Creates New Post: Original stays intact, clone counts toward limit
Profile Edits Don't Affect Old Posts: Saved posts keep their original profile snapshot
